## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Born in State1 in 1991 <br>
Former stateless person without any documents (passport, travel documents)

It took 20 years to finally resolve issue about my documents. 

The international protection is an alternative protection in the absence of national protection. 
When a State persistently fails to safeguard human rights, such as `the right to work` or `the right to housing`, and violations accumulate over time [*Discrimination amounting to persecution*, UNHCR, page 4, Article 14](https://www.unhcr.org/media/guidelines-international-protection-no-1-gender-related-persecution-within-context-article-1a)
 - denying registration as unemployed because of lack of permanent registration for years 
 - failing to provide adequate housing for years for the same reason
 - refusing to hire or dismissing someone for an (imputed) opinion. *(This could compel disclosure of private beliefs and thereby violate the nonâ€‘derogable `right to freedom of thought`, in my opinion.)*
   
Those breaches, when accumulated, may amount to a serious violation comparable to breaches of fundamental, non-derogable rights. 
This may be sufficient for international protection to step in

#### States, by virtue of their membership in the United Nations and as parties to the UN Charter, are obligated to respect and ensure the full spectrum of rights guaranteed by the Charter, including economic and social rights

State1 unilaterally deregistered me as a resident (to nowhere) when I was still a minor child,
effectively rendering me stateless without any legal recourse or court decision. 
They responded with a certificate stating that I was deregistered without a reasoned part why they did it. 
Possible violation of [UDHR](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights), 
[UNCRC](https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/convention-rights-child) and [Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness](https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/convention-reduction-statelessness).  <br>
My legal status remained unresolved, suspended between the bureaucracies of State2 and State1  <br>
<br>
It took almost two decades of persistent effort and struggle (sometimes, literally, living on the streets in State2) to resolve the issue, 
by writing a bunch of letters (applications) to which I receive identical useless responses. <br>

But still I cannot enjoy some of the Rights due to registration requirements (lack of housing, since I was evicted by a State twice)  <br> 

I've consistently inquired about obtaining a travel document for stateless persons to return to State1. <br>
Given these following developments, the protection of social and economic rights appears increasingly fragile...<br>
Even back then, censorship and restrictions were already emerging â€” I had a sense of where things were heading, this why I asked to return to my home to State1 to Europe <br> 
It so strange, these restrictions, many people received their education abroad and have relatives who have been living abroad for a long time...<br>
